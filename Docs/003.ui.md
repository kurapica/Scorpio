# The Scorpio UI Template & Skin System

The **Scorpio.UI** provide the basic ui template system and a skin system.

## Preparation

The **Scorpio.UI** is load on demand, it's not load until some addon need it, so
we should change the toc file, add depends on the Scorpio.UI, and the WOW will
load the **Scorpio.UI** before your addon.

``` toc
## Interface: 80300
## Title: Scorpio Test Addon
## Dependencies: Scorpio.UI
## DefaultState: Enabled
## LoadOnDemand: 0

# main files
ScorpioTest.lua
```

Since the Scorpio.UI depends on the Scorpio, there is no need to add Scorpio in
the Dependencies.

Also you can use

``` lua
LoadAddOn("Scorpio.UI")
```

to Force the loading of the Lib for testing code running in the Game.
