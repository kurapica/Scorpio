# ConfigNode

The config node system is used for adddon configurations, it's designed on the saved variables, but will black box the details. Please don't use it combined with SVMananger(you still can use it, but not recommend).

The config nodes are pre-defined, we can declare the config field with data type and the field value handler, so the system can learn how to automatically generate the config UI panel for the addon.


## A simple start

Here is an example addon to show how to use the config node system, a simple addon have one saved variables:

```toc
## Interface: 90205
## Dependencies: Scorpio
## SavedVariables: TestAddonSave

# Core
TestAddon.lua
```

With one config node field:

```lua
Scorpio "TestAddon" ""

function OnLoad()
	-- Binding the _Config with the saved variables
	-- Must be used within the OnLoad
	_Config:SetSavedVariable("TestAddonSave")
end

-- Declare a field "log" to the _Config with default value 3
-- the function's content will be called when player entering the game
-- or the field value changed
-- The "log" is the field name
__Config__(_Config, "log", 3)
function SetLogLevel(lvl)
	print("[Config]Log Level is", lvl)
end

--- Declare a slash command to change the log level of the addon
__SlashCmd__ "test" "log"
function OnSlashCmdLogLevel(lvl)
	-- Call the SetLogLevel to change the level
    SetLogLevel(floor(lvl))
end
```

So, with the addon:

1. Entering the game, it'll print the `[Config]Log Level is 3`.
2. Then use `/test log 1`, it'll print `[Config]Log Level is 1`.
3. Reload the game, it'll print `[Config]Log Level is 1`, so the field data is saved and can be reloaded.

The main purpose of the config node system is to split the saved variable declaration and handlers to where it's used, and just keep using the pure function code style to simple the codes.

We use `3` as the default value of the `log` field, so the field will be declared to accept number value only.

The field value type can be any enum or struct type, we'll see the details later. Based on the types, the system can choose the matched UI widget to show or modify the field value when the **auto-gen config panel** is used.

As you can see, the `SetLogLevel` used in `OnSlashCmdLogLevel` is not the same we defined, with the `__Config__` attribute, the `SetLogLevel` is replaced by a new function that will validate the input value and save the value to the relative field.

When the field value is changed, an observable subject will distribute the changes, the original `SetLogLevel` that we declared as the handler has already subscribed the subject, so it'll receive the updatings and print out the result.

We also can use the **Style** system to bind the config node field's value to UI elements for direct usages, we'll see it later.


## Global, Char, Spec, WarMode Config Node

In the example, `_Config` is used to bind saved variable, and used to declare the config field with handlers by `__Config__`. Just like `_Addon`, `_Name`, the `_Config` is a property of the Scorpio Modules, it'll only be created when it's accessed for the first time.

The `_Config` represents the global config for all the characters, there are config node for other usages, there is the full list:

1. `_Config` as the global config for all characters.

2. `_CharConfig` for each character, `_CharConfig` can use `SetSavedVariable` method bind a new saved variable for the character only, or it'll use the global saved variable to save it's config data.

3. `_SpecConfig` for character's specialization(In classic, the specialization will always be 1).

4. `_WarModeConfig` for specialization's warmode(pve, pvp, in classic, the warmode will always be pve).

So, when player switch the specialization, the spec config node will be re-inited by the saved variables, and all the handlers will receive the new field values, the warmode config node works the same way.

The `_SpecConfig` and `_WarModeConfig`  can't use the `SetSavedVariable`.

Now, we can have a more complex example:


```toc
## Interface: 90205
## Dependencies: Scorpio
## SavedVariables: TestAddonSave
## SavedVariablesPerCharacter: TestAddonCharSave

# Core
TestAddon.lua
```

So the addon have a new saved variable per character, we can have multi node fields:

```lua
Scorpio "TestAddon" ""

function OnLoad()
	-- Binding the config nodes with the saved variables
	_Config:SetSavedVariable("TestAddonSave")
	_CharConfig:SetSavedVariable("TestAddonCharSave")
end

-- Declare a field "log" to the _Config with default value 3
__Config__(_Config, "log", 3)
function SetLogLevel(lvl)
	print("[Config]Log Level is", lvl)
end

-- The data type is member struct with two members, data like `{ x = 1, y = 3 }`
__Config__(_CharConfig, "location", {
	x = Number,
	y = Number
})
function SetLocation(loc)
	print("[CharConfig]Location is", Toolset.tostring(loc))
end

-- The data type is an array of number, data like `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }`
__Config__(_SpecConfig, "action", { Number })
function SetActions(actions)
	print("[SpecConfig]Actions are", Toolset.tostring(actions))
end

-- The data type is Boolean, data like `true|false`, default true
__Config__(_WarModeConfig, "mode", true)
function SetWarMode(mode)
	print("[WarModeConfig]Mode is", mode)
end
```

The usage of `__Config__`  is

```lua
__Config__(configNode[, name][, type][, default])
```

It's combined with four elements:

1. **Config node** or sub config node, required.

2. **Field name**, optional, the function name will be used as default.

3. **Field data type**, optional, it can be any scalar, enum, member struct or array type. The system can figure out the scalar data type based on the default value(Number, String, Boolean), the type can be the data type or a table to describe the struct.

4. **Default**, optional, the default value.


## Config Node and Sub-Node

The config node is the container of node fields. It also can contains sub-config nodes. You can take the sub-nodes as field groups.

Besides the pre-defined config nodes like `_Config`. We can simply get the sub-node by `_Config[SubNodeName]`, here is an example:

```lua
Scorpio "TestAddon" ""

form = Dialog("Test")

__Config__(_Config.Panel, "visible", true)
function SetPanelVisible(val)
	form:SetShown(val)
end
```

So the sub-nodes can be created when first time accessed. And `_CharConfig` is a sub-node of the `_Config` if the `_CharConfig` don't bind saved variable, the `_SpecConfig` is the sub-node of the `_CharConfig`, the `_WarModeConfig` is the sub-node of the `_SpecConfig`.


## Node Field

The field name can be provided in the `__Config__`, or use the function name as the field name directly. When a field is declared, we can access the field by `_Config[field]`, the result is an observable subject:

```lua
Scorpio "TestAddon" ""

form = Dialog("Test")

__Config__(_Config.Panel, "visible", true)
function SetPanelVisible(val)
	-- the current value can be fetched from the subject
	print(_Config.Panel.visible:GetValue())
end

-- Bind the field to the form's visible style
Style[form].visible = _Config.Panel.visible
```

So we can access the sub node and field with the same code pattern, the sub node will be create automatically when accessed, the field can only be accessed after declaration.


## Node Field Type

All node field has types, the **PLoop** has provided the data type framework, but we don't need go deep into the **PLoop**, since the data types could be used by the field is limited.


### Scalar Type

For now serveral scalar types provided, we can create more but normally there is no need to do.

* Boolean
* String
* Number
* Integer
* PositiveNumber
* NegativeNumber
* NaturalNumber
* NegativeInteger
* RangeValue[{min, max[, step]}]

The range value is special, a silder bar will be used to display that, the value is between [min, max] and with the given step.
The `RangeValue` is a templat struct type, it can receive several template parameters for advanced usages.

```lua
Scorpio "TestAddon" ""

__Config__(_Config, "opacity", RangeValue[{0, 1, 0.01}], 1)
function SetOpacity(val)
	print("The opacity is " .. val)
end
```


### Enum Type

Besides the scalar types, enum values can be used, the system will use a comboBox for the data type. enum value can be simply defined:

```lua
enum "FlyoutDirection" {
    "UP",
    "DOWN",
    "LEFT",
    "RIGHT",
}
```

You can use the **Cube** to browse the existed enums.
