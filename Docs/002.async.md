# Asynchronous Framework & Task Schedule System

As an example to show how the asynchronous works, we take an simple example of count down:

``` lua
Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

local function countDown(cnt)
    print(cnt)
    if cnt > 1 then
        C_Timer.After(1, function() countDown(cnt - 1) end)  -- use the callback
    end
end

__SlashCmd__ "sct" "cd"   -- /sct cd 10  count down from 10 to 1 per sec
function CountDown(cnt)
    countDown(floor(cnt))
end
```

So when we use the `/sct cd 10`, we'll have a 10 sec count down, this is normally be done
with frame's OnUpdate or the C_Timer.

With the Scorpio's asynchronous framework, it'll be done like

``` lua
Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

__Async__()               -- So the function will be processed in a Lua coroutine
__SlashCmd__ "sct" "cd"   -- /sct cd 10  count down from 10 to 1 per sec
function CountDown(cnt)
    for i = floor(cnt), 1, -1 do
        Delay(1)          -- Wait 1 sec

        print(i)
    end
end
```

So we only need use `__Async__()` attribute on the function, it'll be processed in
the Lua coroutine, that means we can use APIs like `Delay` to yield the function process
and resume the process when the delay time is meet.

With the asynchronous framework, we can put logics that splitted in several functions
into one function, so we can avoid the usage of callbacks. The callback mechanism may be
a disaster in some case. Let's have an example:

``` lua
-- We make a combat time count
local inCombat = false
local count = 0

local function countCombat()
  if inCombat then
    count = count + 1
    print("The combat still going for " .. count .. " sec")

    C_Timer.After(1, countCombat)
  else
    print("The combat is done, last for " .. count .. "sec")
  end
end

local frame = CreateFrame("Frame")
frame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED")
frame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED")

frame:SetScript("OnEvent", function(event)
    if event == "PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED" then
        -- Start the combat
        inCombat = true
        count = 0
        C_Timer.After(1, countCombat)
    else
        -- The combat is stopped
        inCombat = false
    end
end)
```

So we have to split the logic into several places, the `countCombat` use C_Timer.After
for callback, we also need create frame to register and handle the event.

With the Scorpio, we can do it in one function:

``` lua
Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

__SystemEvent__() __Async__()
function PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED()
    Delay(1) -- Wait one sec before count down

    local count = 1
    while InCombatLockdown() do  -- Check if in combat
        print("The combat still going for " .. count .. " sec")
        Delay(1)
        count = count + 1
    end

    print("The combat is done, last for " .. count .. "sec")
end
```

We use `__SystemEvent__` instead of creating frame and registering system events, we
use the Delay to keep the count logic in one function call, instead of using call back
for several times.

So we don't need to check our logic in several places, and we can solve problems in
the same context instead of using states between several functions.

To meet the requirement, the asynchronous framewrok provided several features.


## Useful attributes

Besides the `__SystemEvent__` , `__SlashCmd__`, `__SecureHook`, the system provided
another three useful attributes(although there are dozens, but I don't think you need
to use them all).

1. `__NoCombat__` -  Mark the global function(also the module event handler like OnLoad)
    defined in a Scorpio module, so it'll be real called when out of combat.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" "1.0.0"

    __NoCombat__() __SystemEvent__()
    function GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE()
        -- Update panel like grids
    end
    ```

    The `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` system event means the raid|party group is changed, so
    we may need to update the panel, but we can't do it during the combat, so give it
    `__NoCombat__` attribute will make sure it'll only be real called out of combat.
    (It's just an example, in the real addon, we can handle it by using secure templates).

    We also can do it like

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" "1.0.0"

    __NoCombat__()
    function UpdatePanel()
        -- Update panel like grids
    end

    __SystemEvent__()
    function GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE()
        UpdatePanel()
    end
    ```

    You can apply those attribute on any global functions.


2. `__Async__`  -- Mark the global function defined in a Scorpio module, so it
    would be called as a corooutine(the thread in Lua).

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" "1.0.0"

    -- /sct cd 10               -- count down from 10 to 1 per sec
    __Async__() __SlashCmd__ "sct" "cd"
    function CountDown(cnt)
        cnt = tonumber(cnt)
        if cnt then
            for i = floor(cnt), 1, -1 do
                print(i)
                Delay(1)        -- Delay 1 sec, explained later
            end
        end
    end
    ```

    In the function, **Delay(1)** API is used to make the code stop and resume
    it after 1 sec, it requires the function must be run as a thread. So we use
    `__Async__()` mark the function as a thread, and use `__SlasCmd__"sct" "cd"`
    mark is as a slash command so we can test it.

3. `__Iterator__`   -- Mark the global function as an iterator that can be used
    in `for do - end`. The function will be run as a thread, so in it, need use
    coroutine.yield to yield values like :

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" "1.0.0"

    __Iterator__()
    function Fib(i, j, max)
        local prev, nxt = i, j

        for i = 1, max do
            local s = prev + nxt
            prev, nxt = nxt, s

            coroutine.yield(i, s)
        end
    end

    for i, f in Fib(1, 1, 10) do
        print(i, f)
    end
    ```

    So the Fib is used as an iterator, it's very useful to produce many values
    in many times just in one call(so all states will be local variables in the
    function, no need to use upvalues between several functions).


4. `__AsyncSingle__([override])`   -- mark the global function as asynchronous,
so if the previous call is not finished, the next call will be cancelled, you
don't need to do the check by yourself. If set the `override` to true, the next
call will cancel the previous call.

    ```lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    local token = 0

    __SlashCmd__ "test"
    __AsyncSingle__()
    function test()
        token = token + 1

        local curr = token

        for i = 1, 5 do
            print("[CASE1]", curr, i)
            Delay(2)
        end
    end

    __SlashCmd__ "test2"
    __AsyncSingle__(true)
    function test2()
        token = token + 1

        local curr = token

        for i = 1, 5 do
            print("[CASE2]", curr, i)
            Delay(2)
        end
    end
    ```

    So you can use `/test` and `/test2` to start two different cases, the first
    case you can type three times the `/test` in 5 second, only the first will be
    executed.

    And for the next case, you can type `/test2`, and after 3 second, type `/test`
    again, you will see the first call is cancelled.


## Asynchronous Framework

When we use the `__Async__` mark a global function, it'll be processed in the
coroutine, so we can yield it and resume it, but it's not easy for common authors.

The Scorpio provided several methods to cover the usage of the thread, so the
authors can use a more humanized way to solve the problems.

1. `Delay(sec)` - yield and continue the thread after a delay(second). we already
    have shown the examples.

2. `Next()` - yield and continue the thread in the next phase, if the fps is 60,
    one phase will be 1/60 ~= 0.0167 sec after the previous phase. So it's a good
    way to process animations.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    local txt = UIParent:CreateTexture("ARTWORK")
    txt:SetPoint("CENTER")
    txt:SetSize(100, 100)
    txt:SetColorTexture(1, 1, 1)

    __Async__()
    function FadeOut(self)
      local total = 60 * 4 -- 60FPS * 4 sec
      local count = total

      repeat
        count   = count - 1

        self:SetAlpha(count / total)
        
        Next()  -- Wait next phase
      until count == 0
    end

    FadeOut(txt)
    ```

    With the code, a white color box will be shown on the center, and it'll fade
    out in 4 sec.

    It's also a good way to avoid several calls in one phase, take the `BAG_UPDATE`
    event as an example(normally we could use `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` instead of it):

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable()
        while true do
            NextEvent("BAG_UPDATE") -- Wait for the system event

            Next()                  -- Wait one phase

            -- Scan the containers
            for bag = 0, NUM_BAG_FRAMES do
                for slot = 1, GetContainerNumSlots(bag) do
                    local itemId = GetContainerItemID(bag, slot)
                end
            end
        end
    end
    ```

    The `BAG_UPDATE` will be triggered several times in one phase, so if we
    handle it directly, we may cost cpu for repeated works. Wait one phase is
    an easier way to reduce it.

3. `Continue()` - yield and continue the thread as soon as possible, there is limit
    time to process the Lua functions, if we process to many operations in one phase,
    the screen will be freezed, so we'll have lags.

    The `Continue` will yield the thread and check if the phase have enough time
    to resume the thread.

    Here is an example to show a big cycle without fps dropping:

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    __SlashCmd__ "sct" "start"  -- use `/sct start` to start the process
    function BigCycle()
        local time = GetTime()
        local prev = 0
        for i = 1, 10^7 do
            if i%10 == 0 then
                Continue() -- The frame will freeze if miss this

                if time ~= GetTime() then
                    -- Means the thread is resumed in the next frame OnUpdate
                    time = GetTime()

                    -- Here is the current time and the cycle count of the previous phase
                    -- On my laptop(i7-9750H), it's about 14600(10 level) or 20000(1 level)
                    print(time, i - prev)
                    prev = i
                end
            end
        end
    end
    ```

    Although the Scorpio will try to drop a little FPS to gain more process power,
    you still can use `/scorpio taskfactor 0.2`(default 0.4) to reduce the max phase
    process time, so the fps dropping will be totally erased.

4. `NextEvent(event)` - yield and continue the thread when the target system event is fired,
    the system event arguments will be returned.

    This is an example taking from my addon, used to wait until the `Blizzard_BattlefieldMap`
    is loaded.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable(self)
        if not IsAddOnLoaded("Blizzard_BattlefieldMap") then
            -- Waiting the target addon is loaded
            -- The ADDON_LOADED's argument is the addon name that loaded
            while NextEvent("ADDON_LOADED") ~= "Blizzard_BattlefieldMap" do end
        end

        -- start init the addon
    end
    ```

5. `NextSecureCall([target, ]targetFunc[, ...])` - yield and continue the thread
    when the target function is called.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable()
        while true do
            print("Player is inputing", NextSecureCall("ChatEdit_OnEditFocusGained"))
        end
    end
    ```

    The arguments will be returned, but if you specfic the arguments in the `NextSecureCall`
    the given arguments will be returned.

6. `NoCombat()` - yield the thread if in combat and contine the thread when out of combat.
    This is defined based on the `NextEvent`, so we can do some operations out of the combat.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable()
      while true do
        NextEvent("BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED") -- Wait the bag update
        NoCombat()                      -- make sure the player is not in combat

        -- do the bag refreshing
      end
    end
    ```

7. `Wait(event[, ...])` `Wait(delay, event[, ...])` - yield and continue the thread when
    one of the registered event fired or meet the delay time. If one event is fired, its
    name and arguments will be returned.

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __SystemEvent__() __Async__()
    function BANKFRAME_OPENED()
        repeat
        -- Scan the bank until the bank is closed
        until "BANKFRAME_CLOSED" == Wait("BANKFRAME_CLOSED", "BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED", "PLAYERBANKSLOTS_CHANGED", "PLAYERREAGENTBANKSLOTS_CHANGED")
    end

    __SystemEvent__() __Async__()
    function PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED()
        local count = 0

        -- Another way to count the combat time
        -- since time out will return nothing and when the event
        -- is fired, the event name will be returned
        while not Wait(1, "PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED") do
            count = count + 1
            print("The combat is going for " .. count .. " sec")
        end

        print("The combat is done, last for " .. count .. " sec")
    end
    ```

With the `__Async__` and those APIs, it's very simple to keep all logic in one function.


8. `NextUnitEvent(unit, event)` - yield and continue the thread when the target unit system event is fired,
    the system event arguments will be returned(without the event name and unit).

    Here is an example to handle the player health changes:

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable(self)
        while true do
            NextEvent("player", "UNIT_HEALTH")
            print("[player]", UnitHealth("player"))
        end
    end
    ```

9. `WaitUnitEvent(unit, [delay,] event, ...)` - yield and continue the thread when
    one of the registered event fired for the specfic unit or meet the delay time. If one event is fired, its
    name and arguments will be returned(without the unit name).

    ``` lua
    Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

    __Async__()
    function OnEnable(self)
        while true do
            if WaitUnitEvent("player", "UNIT_HEALTH", "UNIT_POWER_UPDATE") == "UNIT_HEALTH" then
                print("[player]", UnitHealth("player"))
            else
                print("[player]", UnitPower("player"))
            end
        end
    end
    ```


## Custom System Event

Besides the system event fired by the WOW itself, we also can fire custom events, it works
like the system event, so we can use `__SystemEvent__`, `NextEvent`, `Wait` for those custom
events.

> `FireSystemEvent(event, ...)`
>
> Fire a custom or system events with arguments

``` lua
Scorpio "ScorpioTest" ""

__Async__()
function OnEnable(self)
    if not IsAddOnLoaded("Blizzard_BattlefieldMap") then
        while NextEvent("ADDON_LOADED") ~= "Blizzard_BattlefieldMap" do end
    end

    -- Notify the other modules that the BattlefieldMapFrame is preapred
    FireSystemEvent("EBFM_ZONEMAP_INITED", BattlefieldMapFrame)
end

__SystemEvent__()
function EBFM_ZONEMAP_INITED(self)
    -- Add quest data to the BattlefieldMapFrame
    self:AddDataProvider(CreateFromMixins(QuestBlobDataProviderMixin))
end
```

To avoid the conflict between addons, please use your addon name as the prefix to the events.
You can also fire the system event like `PLAYER_HEALTH`, but only addon modules generated by
Scorpio will receive it.


## Use Asynchronous APIs with Callback

Although the Scorpio recommend using the Asynchronous functions, we still can pass function to
those APIs as callback:

API                                                 |Description
----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
Continue(func[, ...])                               |Call the func with arguments as soon as possible.
Next(func[, ...])                                   |Call the func with arguments in the next frame OnUpdate.
Delay(delay, func[, ...])                           |Call the func with arguments after a delay(second).
NextEvent(event, func[, ...])                       |Call the func when a system event is fired. If there is no arguments, the system event's argument should be used.
Wait(func[,delay][,event[, ...]])                   |Call the func when one of the registered events fired or meet the delay time, if it's resumed by a system event, the name and its arguments would be passed to the func.
Wait(func[,event[, ...]])                           |Call the func when one of the registered events fired, the event name and its arguments would be passed to the func.
NoCombat(func[, ...])                               |Call the func with arguments when not in combat.
NextSecureCall(func, [target, ]targetFunc[, ...])   |Call the func with arguments when the target's target secure method is called.
NextEvent(unit, event, func[, ...])                 |Call the func when an unit system event is fired. If there is no arguments, the system event's argument should be used.
Wait(func, unit[,delay][,event[, ...]])             |Call the func when one of the registered events for specfic unit fired or meet the delay time, if it's resumed by a system event, the name and its arguments would be passed to the func.
Wait(func, unit[,event[, ...]])                     |Call the func when one of the registered events for specfic unit fired, the event name and its arguments would be passed to the func.

You also can use them outside the Scoprio addon modules, like call `Scorpio.Delay`. Please keep
in mind the callback function will be processed in a coroutine.

``` lua
-- use Scorpio without the first line `Scorpio "Test" ""`
-- to change the code environment, so we need use Scorpio
-- to access its features
Scorpio.Continue(function()
    for i = 1, 10^7 do
        -- Since the function will be processed in coroutine
        -- We don't need use callback style here
        Scorpio.Next()
        print(GetTime())
    end
end)
```


## Thread Pool & Task scheduling system

In normal Lua coding, creating and disposing the coroutines are very expensive, that's also
why we normally use the callback not the coroutine(the coroutine is also a little hard for
common authors).

We already see how to use the asynchronous APIs to simple the usage of the coroutine, the cost
is also reduced by the [PLoop][] and [Scorpio][].

The [PLoop][] has provided a thread pool system for `__Async__`, so when a function is called,
a coroutine will be fetched from the thread pool, run the function, and put the coroutine back
to the thread pool when function done its tasks.

So the coroutine can be reused, the cost of creating and disposing is largely reduced. Since
this is done in the core of the system, the authors don't need to understand how it works.

The resume operations provided by the Asynchronous APIs is not as simple as it seems. A Task
Scheduling system handles the resume operations.

It will check the FPS and calcuate the max code time for one phase, it'll resume threads if
there is still enough time in the phase, and keep threads wating if there is no more time until
the next phase.

There are several settings about this, change then will effect the FPS and how quick to consume
tasks. The more fps dropping, the quick to finish tasks.

1. `/Scorpio taskthreshold [5-100]` set the task threshold, the max task operation time per phase,
    the smaller the system more smooth, default 15.

2. `/Scorpio taskfactor [0.1-1]` set the task factor, The factor used to calculate the task operation
    time per phase, the smaller the system more smooth, default 0.4.

3. `/Scorpio overtime [0.1-1]` - set the overtime factor, the fatcor used to calculate the most time
    for the remain tasks, used to give more time to a phase to finish the remain tasks, default 0.3.

So you can change them based on your computer.
